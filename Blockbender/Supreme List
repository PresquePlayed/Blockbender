Idea pool:
- Money should pay for tokens.
- AI should set home area as well as town, so they return at night.
- Cook all stews?
- Cabbages! (crop).
- Water skin (hold in chestplate slot) (Durability bar on how much water it is holding)
- Sokka's club, maybe boomerang too.
- Unique earth element tool (IDEAS: Dai Li gloves, Toph's bracelet, metalbender wires?)
- Fire war balloons
- Add remaining statues (Aang, Korra, Kuruk).
- Bison fly.
- Villager trading to obtain novice tokens.
        - Benders added to villages, attack aggressive players, can obtain adept tokens from them.
        - Masters added to villages, attack aggressive players, random chance of appearing (higher chance in bigger towns eg north tribe), can obtain master tokens from them.
- Spirit world ideas
    - Giant plants/spirits
    - Spirit grass under top layer
        - Change texture (More smooth ie clay block)
        - Shouldn't break instantly
    - Spirits that look like blocks
        - Run away when you try and break them
    - Structures
        - Wan Shi Ton's library
        - Tree of Time
        - Random things
    - When you die, you need to spawn in the overworld
- Water tribe money, random chance of being accepted.
-New bending system?
    - When you choose your element, you already have 10 BASIC moves
        - e.g. For water: Push, pull, rise, fall, freeze/thaw, etc
    - On their own, none are particularly effective.
    - At the beginning, mashing keys should not help
        - Each move should be weak
    - Finding scrolls/being trained gives you a combination
        - If allies want to share combo's they know, they have to craft a scroll
    - Using the combination results in a move (probably much like current moves)
    - To make the moves more powerful (Novice/Adept/Master) you should visit villages to train with benders
        - Scrolls can only get you novice strength
    - This way, bending satchel can be irradicated, scrolls don't need to be carried to bend, and you can't lose moves
